# Spring-Vue-Shopping-Site

This is a project created for studying.

Vue is used for the front and Spring is used for the back end.

The authentication function uses Spring-Security.


## Docker


The database uses Postgre and Tomcat 9 is used as the application server.

Everything is created with Docker.

Deploy the project war file to Docker's Tomcat container.

In addition, Postgre will automatically populate the required database and initial data when creating a Docker container.

## Dev

During development, I set Vue's port to 8888 so that it doesn't conflict with Spring.


## Why I chose Vue


I think the thymeleaf available in Spring is very powerful, 

but when compared to the Vue I'm used to, I think Vue is overwhelmingly superior.

Not only does Vue have a clear segregation of screens and logic, but it also works very well with other modules.


## Why I chose BootStrap

BootStrap is a very powerful front framework.

If there are many related books, there is a lot of information, and it looks great. It also has the advantage of being easy to understand for everyone who uses it.
